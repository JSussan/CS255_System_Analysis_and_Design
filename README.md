# CS255 System Analysis and Design
Explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools.

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is DriverPass which is owned by Liam. Ian is the information technology officer for DriverPass. Aside from owner and IT, users will also include admin and customers. The purpose of this project is to create a new system for DriverPass to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for DMV driving tests.

# What did you do particularly well?
I enjoyed and felt like I well on my UML diagrams. I created several UML diagrams including activity, sequence, and class diagrams.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
On my login activity diagram, I would insert an activity that would lock a user out and notify IT if more than a set number of failed login attempts occured.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs in my system design by decomposing each of their requests into requirements. Requirements provided me with guidance on what I needed to do to meet the user's requests. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because you want your customer to be happy with the product you develop for them.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I feel that I learned a lot of fundamentals in this course when it comes to the software development lifecycle. Gathering user needs, turning them into requirements, both functional and non-functional, creating UML diagrams such a activity, sequence, and class, and how to keep all this inforation well orgranized. I will be using all of these techniques moving forward when I analyze and design a system.
